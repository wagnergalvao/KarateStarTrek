# Welcome to STAPI, a Star Trek API!
### But what is it, really?
- It's the first public Star Trek API, accessible via REST and SOAP.
- It's an open source project, that anyone can contribute to.
- STAPI is now a beta version. The API model is considered stable at this point.

### How it works?
- STAPI uses publicly available sources, mainly Memory Alpha, to get its data.
- Data is cleansed, standardized and put into relational model.
- API can be browsed by anyone, even right now, using API Browser.
- SOAP contracts and Swagger specifications can be downloaded.
- STAPI is written in Java, with tests written in Groovy.
- Clients are available in several languages.
